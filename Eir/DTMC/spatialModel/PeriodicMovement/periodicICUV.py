        k: float optional
            Default is 5.0. The number which divides 2*pi in order to determine the mean of the distribution of thetas when movement occurs. For example, if k=5, then the mean of the normal distribution from which thetas are picked is 2*pi/5.0.
        
        std: float optional
            Default is pi/2. The standard deviation which is used for the distribution of thetas when movement occurs.

        Scollect, Ecollect, Icollect, Lcollect, ICUcollect, Rcollect, Dcollect, Vcollect: list

        S, E, I, L, ICU, R, D, V, infectious: ndarray
            Numpy arrays that contain the total number of people in each state on each given day. Infectious people are classified as those in compartment I + those in compartments L.
        
        run(getDetails=True): method
            Has parameter getDetails set to True by default. Actually runs the simulation after the object is constructed. If getDetails=True, then the method
            returns a Simul_Details object that will allow user to get more details about the simulation, such as transmissions, state transfers, etc.
        
        toDataFrame(): method
            After running the 'run' method, toDataFrame will convert the numpy arrays to a pandas DataFrame and return it.
