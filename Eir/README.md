# Eir: Python Package for Simulating Epidemics

Eir is a package that focuses on allowing the user to simulate epidemics using spatial models. Eir mainly focuses on stochastic simulations, but offers a few deterministic models as well. The four spatial model types are: Strong Infectious, Hub Model, Periodic Mobility Model, and Random Movement model. Each model makes different assumptions about the spread and movements of the people in the simulation. The Strong Infectious and Hub Model are taken from researchers Fujie & Odagaki, so it is a good idea to read their paper at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32288078/. The Random Movement model assumes that at each state, an individual is equally likely to move in any direction for a random distance, pulled from a normal distribution. The Periodic Mobility models attemtpts to capture the routine in people's lives by modelling each individuals movement as movement along a circle.
