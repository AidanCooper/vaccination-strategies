In order to run each test, after forking the repository, go to each of the python file for each of the tests and run the following in the shell:

```shell

python3 <NAME_OF_FILE>
```

For example, if I wanted to run the test for the HubSEIRSV model, the following command would be run:

```shell

python3 test_HubSEIR.py

```
