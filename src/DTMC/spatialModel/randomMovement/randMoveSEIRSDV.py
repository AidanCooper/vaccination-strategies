class RandMoveSEIRSDV(RandMoveSEIRDV):
    """
    Class that simulates the random movement model with an SEIRSDV model. People in the Exposed compartment are presumed to not be able to propogate infection.

    Parameters:
    ----------

    S0: int

    I0: int
        The starting number of infectious individuals in the simulation. 
    
    R0: int
        The starting number of recovered individuals in the simulation.
    
    rho: float
        The probability of someone going from the E compartment to the I compartment.

    gamma: float
        The recovery probability of an individual going from I -> R.
    
    kappa: float
        The probability of going from R compartment to S compartment.
    
    mu: float
        The probability of dying if one hasn't recovered in the same time step.
    
    eta: float
        The probability of going from S->V Compartment, given that the person didn't go from S->E.
    
    planeSize : float
        The length of each side of the square plane in which the individuals are confined to. For example,
        if planeSize=50, then the region which people in the simulation are confined to is the square with
        vertices (0,0), (50,0), (50,50), and (0,50).
    
    move_r: float
        The mean of the movement radius of each person in the simulation. Will be used as mean along with 
        sigma_R as the standard deviation to pull from a normal distribution movement radii each time 
        _move(day) function is called.
    
    sigma_R: float
        The standard deviation of the movement radius of each person in the simulation. Will be used along with

        called.

    spread_r: float
        The mean of the spreading radius of each person in the simulation. Will be used along with sigma_r 
        as the standard deviation to pull from an normal distribution spreading radii for each individaul person
        when the RandMoveSIS object is initialized. 
    
    sigma_r: float
        The standard deviation of the spreading radius of each person in the simulation. 
        Will be used along with spread_r as the mean to pull from an normal distribution spreading radii 
        for each individaul person when the RandMoveSIS object is initialized. 
    
    days: int
        The number of days that was simulated.

        The probability of infection if the distance between an infectious person and susceptible person is 0. Default is 1.0.
    
    alpha: float optional
        A constant used in the _infect() method. The greater the constant, the greater the infection probability. Default is 2.0

    Rcollect: list
        Used to keep track of the states each Person object is in. If the copy of a Person object has 
        isIncluded == True, then the person is RECOVERED. Has a total of popsize Person objects,
        with numbers [0, popsize).
    
    Dcollect: list
         Used to keep track of the states each Person object is in. If the copy of a Person object has

        with numbers [0, popsize).
    
    Vcollect: list
        Used to keep track of the states each Person object is in. If the copy of a Person object has 
        isIncluded == True, then the person is VACCINATED. Has a total of popsize Person objects,
        with numbers [0, popsize).


    details: Simul_Details 
        An object that can be returned to give a more in-depth look into the simulation. With this object,
        one can see transmission chains, state changes, the movement history of each individaul, the state
        history of each person, and more.
